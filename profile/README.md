## 🔐 Security Architecture

**HESCLO does not offer a shared cloud – we offer isolated private clouds.**

- Each client receives a **dedicated, fully isolated VM** on our Proxmox infrastructure
- **No containerization, no shared environments**, no risk of data leaks
- Access only via **highly secured VPNs**, **YubiKey-based authentication**, and **blocked east-west communication**
- Internal infrastructure such as database servers, control services & register systems reside in **separate, isolated networks**
- Complete **end-to-end encryption** for both storage and transmission

**Host software, systems, or entire infrastructures – with full control.**

- Clients can rent **dedicated bare-metal or virtual servers**
- Define **which ports** are open and **which IPs** are allowed
- Build secure tunnels, firewalled connections, and custom VPN routes
- Install custom software or request our preconfigured hardened images
